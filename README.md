Starting with a blank vault:

## 1. Create a folder
The folder can have any name. I use `_seedbox` because:
- It is easy to remember.
- It does not collide with many other notes, which helps with moving files into it using Obsidian's "Move file to another folder" feature.
- The underscore sorts it to the top of the vault hierarchy, by default.

## 2. Create more folders

- "relegation" will be used to hold seedlings which _are not immediately actionable_. That means you don't want to delete it, but you don't want to prioritize doing anything with it either.
- "growing" will hold seedlings which are actively accruing knowledge.

The purpose of moving seedlings into these folders is to remove them from the review process, which will be outlined in a following step.

## 3. Change your settings to put new files into the Seedbox

Changing "New link format" is recommended, but not necessary. Doing this makes it so you always see "__seedbox/" at the start of your links, which provides benefit by bringing your attention to the fact that you are linking, or have linked, to an idea that is not "grown".

## 4. Use it
The best way to learn to use the Seedbox is by reading the articles I have previously written about it:
- [What A Seedbox Is and Why It Has Been Useful To Me](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/what-a-seedbox-is-and-why-it-has-been-valuable-to-me/4344)
- [2021 Seedbox Update](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/2021-seedbox-update/28554)

### Record
Go ahead and let most of your new notes just go directly into the Seedbox. Don't worry about organizing them. You can do that later. 

### Review
The most important part of the system is _to go back and look through the Seedbox regularly_. It is intended to be looked through, frequently, and used to re-attach to old ideas, using them as a platform for generating new ones.

### Remove
The end goal of the seedbox (for how I use it), is to produce "evergreen notes". That is, a note that is cohesive, coherent, and useful. Once a note has achieved this, remove it from the Seedbox and plant it in your knowledge garden!
